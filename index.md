# Hello World!
My name is Yves Velasquez and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/)
and my major is computer science!

## Computer Science Projects
Here are a couple of my computer science projects! You can find them here on my github page https://github.com/HallowsYves

## CPSC 120
Below are three of my favorite labs I have done this semster!

## Lab 10
Near the end of the semester, we worked with images and this lab had to be one of my favorites. In particular Lab 10 part 3 was my favorite as we ended up creating a colored square though the GraphicsMagick libray. At first I struggled with coming up with the proper gradient however with enough time I eventually was able to produce the gradient seen below.

## Lab 8
Another lab that I enjoyed was learning how to use loops and characters in order to display animations to the console. In this lab we worked with the chono_literals libray to help verify arguments inserted into the console and to open and display them. 

Below is an example of a finished animation
